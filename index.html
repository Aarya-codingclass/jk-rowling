        <p>Joanne Rowling, CH, OBE, HonFRSE, FRCPE, FRSL (/ˈroʊlɪŋ/ ROH-ling;[1] born 31 July 1965), known by her pen
            name J. K. Rowling, is a British author, philanthropist, film producer, and screenwriter. She is the author
            of the Harry Potter series, which has won multiple awards and sold more than 500 million copies as of
            2018,[2] and in 2008 became the best-selling book children's series in history.[3] The books are the basis
            of a popular film series. She also writes crime fiction under the pen name Robert Galbraith.
            <br>
            Born in Yate, Gloucestershire, Rowling was working as a researcher and bilingual secretary for Amnesty
            International in 1990 when she conceived the idea for the Harry Potter series while on a delayed train from
            Manchester to London. The seven-year period that followed saw the death of her mother, birth of her first
            child, divorce from her first husband, and relative poverty until the first novel in the series, Harry
            Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, was published in 1997. There were six sequels, of which the last was
            released in 2007. Since then, Rowling has written several books for adult readers: The Casual Vacancy (2012)
            and – under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith – the crime fiction Cormoran Strike series. In 2020, her
            "political fairytale" for children, The Ickabog, was released in instalments in an online version.
            <br>
            Rowling has progressed from living on benefits to being named the world's first billionaire author by
            Forbes,[4] an assertion that she disputed.[5] Forbes reported that she lost her billionaire status after
            giving away much of her earnings to charity.[6] The 2021 Sunday Times Rich List estimated Rowling's fortune
            at £820 million, ranking her as the 196th richest person in the UK.[7] Rowling was appointed a member of the
            Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to literature and
            philanthropy. She established the Volant Charitable Trust to support at-risk women, children and young
            people and has supported multiple charities, including Comic Relief, Gingerbread, and multiple sclerosis and
            coronavirus disease 2019 causes as well as launching her own charity, Lumos.
